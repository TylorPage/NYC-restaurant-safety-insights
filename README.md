NYC Restaurant Safety Insights: Analyzing Health Code Violations and Risk Patterns
Overview
This project analyzes restaurant inspection data from New York City to uncover trends in health code violations, inspection scores, and food safety risks. The goal is to identify patterns across boroughs, cuisine types, and time in order to provide insights into food safety and inform the public and stakeholders.

The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and dashboard development using Python and Tableau.

Data Source
Dataset: NYC Restaurant Inspection Results

Provided by: NYC Open Data

Format: CSV

Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Tableau

GitHub

Excel (optional for pivoting and quick summaries)

Key Questions
Which boroughs have the highest number of violations?

What are the most common types of health code violations?

Do certain cuisine types tend to receive lower inspection scores?

How do inspection scores change over time?

Process
Data Cleaning

Removed null and duplicate entries

Filtered for valid inspection grades and scores

Standardized column names and categories

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed violations by borough and cuisine type

Explored score distributions and critical vs. non-critical violations

Identified trends in grades over time

Visualization & Dashboard

Built visualizations in Tableau:

Violation counts by borough

Top cuisine types by violation rate

Score trends by year and inspection type

Created filters for cuisine, borough, and date

Results & Insights
Boroughs with the highest violation counts included [Insert Result]

Common violations involved [Insert Violation Types]

Cuisine types such as [Cuisine] had lower average scores

Scores and grades showed [Improvement/Decline] over the past 5 years

How to View the Dashboard
Tableau Public: Link to Tableau Dashboard

Future Improvements
Integrate geospatial visualizations with map overlays

Automate data refresh using Tableau Public or a Python script

Apply predictive modeling to flag high-risk restaurants before inspection
